# PresentIO
PresentIO is a lightweight Mac app (OS X Yosemite or newer) that allows you to mirror your iOS devices to your screen. 

There is nothing to install. Simply connect your device via a Lightning cable and you're ready to go.

### No Install. No Network. No Problem.
You've no doubt used other network-based approaches to mirroring. 
You probably wouldn't be here if you hadn't already run into reliability issues there like I did - spending half of the presentation time trying to “jiggle the handle” and get things working again. 

With PresentIO, you don't need a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection to flawlessly share your device display.


### This is great for:
  - When you don't have a Wi-Fi network available, or your customer won't let you on theirs
  - Doing a demo of your app's offline capabilities
  - Live demos in front of hundreds of people all clobbering your access point
